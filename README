Roadrunner
====================

Roadrunner is a job flow executor. You can submit a job flow (in the form of a json file) to Roadrunner and it will run the jobs
is the given flow and return the status to the contact person via email.

Example use case:
1. Deploy code to all the api hosts and if the job succeeds, then deploy to all the frontend hosts.
2. scp some files from certain hosts to a central host and if that succeeds on atleast 80% of the hosts, then run a consolidation script on the central host having all the copied files.
